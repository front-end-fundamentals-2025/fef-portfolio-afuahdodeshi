      <h4>
        The Art Market in Jakande is a unique gathering space where <br>
artisans bring their creativity to life in ways that are both refreshing and rare. <br>Here, you’ll find carefully crafted jewelry, handmade bags, custom clothing, sculptures, <br>and expressive paintings, each reflecting the individual touch of its creator. <br> What sets these artists apart is their 
 dedication to sourcing materials themselvesstones from the northern caves, <br>leather from local cattle, and other raw elements  that add an authentic richness to each piece. <br>Tucked away from the city’s main routes, the Art Market is a hidden gem that deserves a wider spotlight, <br>offering a glimpse into the untapped creative talents of Jakande. <br>
